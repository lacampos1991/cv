        I am an aspiring web developer on the lookout for an entry-level
        web developer position. I studied at Florida Atlanta University where I
        received my bacholar's degree in computer science. Completed an
        internship with Chelsea Reservations, a small business
        with a reservation system targeted towards private recreational clubs.
        After my internship, I stayed at Chelsea for almost a year working as a
        contractor. I am always looking to improve my skills as a developer, so I am
        usually looking up tutorials on technologies I am not too familiar
        with.
